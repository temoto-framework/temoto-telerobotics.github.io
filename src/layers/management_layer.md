The Management layer helps to manage and categorize the majority of resources. It is composed of four subsystems: the Context Manager, the Sensor Manager, the Output Manager, and the Robot Manager. When TeMoto 2.0 is utilized in a distributed setting, where one instance of the TeMoto 2.0 is applied on the operatorâ€™s computer and the other is applied on the on-board computer of a robot, all the management layers synchronize their resource descriptions. This behaviour allows the Supervisory layer to control resources that are situated on different physical machines.
